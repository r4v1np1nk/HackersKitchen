Togarashi Ribeye

Ingredients
===========
Ribeye (thicker is better)
Salt
Black pepper
Togarashi spice blend
Baking soda (optional)
1-2 Tbsp Butter (optional)
1-2 sprig rosemary (optional)

Process
============
- Sprinkle ribeye generously with salt, pepper, and togarashi
- Sous vide ribeye from 133-137 for 2 hours (133 to ensure more of a traditional pink center, 137 to prioritize rendered fat for flavor and mouthfeel)
- Pat dry
- Bring cast iron to 400-500F (if you want to add a very small amount of oil, use only high smoke point oils like avocado oil)
- While heating cast iron, optionally sprinkle ribeye lightly with baking soda and let sit 5 min to improve sear
- Sear 30-45s each side
- While searing second side, optionally add butter and rosemary to pan. Tilt pan and use basting or serving spoon to baste the top side of the steak, flipping at end to baste other side briefly (~5s) before removing from pan.
- Cut against grain while eating

- Place ground spices back into the frying pan, add the turmeric and just water that things start to become a paste
- Add grapeseed oil and turn heat back on to medium high heat again

Directions - Curry
==================
- Take the chicken thighs and trim all the fat off, cut into cubes that are roughly the same size
- Optional Step (but recommended): Take the 2 tbsp yoghurt and mix with 2 tbsp curry paste, pour over the chicken, cover and allow to sit in the refrigerator for 8 - 12 hours
    - when ready to cook, strain the chicken out
- Heat a pan on medium heat
- After the pan is hot, place ghee in the pan and let the ghee heat up
- Throw the fenugreek, coriander and fennel seeds in the ghee and let them start to cook, until the air gets fragrant (typically 30 - 60 seconds)
    - If the seeds start to smoke turn the heat down a little and stir rapidly
- When things get fragrant, add the diced onion, and cook them in the ghee until they become golden clear
    - Alternatively, you can cook the onions on medium low heat for longer until they are caramelized
- Add the chicken, stir and let it cook until it is just on the verge of golden
- Add the curry paste and stir to coat everything evenly
- Let the mix cook on medium heat for three to five mins, stirring to ensure things don't stick
- When the oil has started to separate add the can of tomatoes, water, sugar, cream and any veggies you want
    - You can also hold veggies back until closer to the end of the simmer time, depending on the veggies you use
- Bring to a simmer and simmer for 20 - 25 mins
- Serve with rice or naan bread, add dried fruit and chopped cashews to plate if using
